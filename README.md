### Quick Installation

**Note:** Only Ubuntu/VPS

1. Clone this repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Security-Tools-Alliance/rengine-ng && cd rengine
    ```

1. Edit the dotenv file, **please make sure to change the password for postgresql `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`!**

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

1. In the dotenv file, you may also modify the Scaling Configurations

    ```bash
    MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
    MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
    ```

    MAX_CONCURRENCY: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reNgine's concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it's set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximised performance.

    MIN_CONCURRENCY: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it's set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.

    These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload's size and complexity

1. Run the installation script, Please keep an eye for any prompt, you will also be asked for username and password for reNgine.

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```
